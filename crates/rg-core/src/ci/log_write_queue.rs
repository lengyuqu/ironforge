//! CI/CD job log write queue.
//!
//! Serialises log writes through a single `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel so that
//! concurrent pipeline jobs do not contend on SQLite writes.  A background
//! consumer task receives log-update requests and executes each one against
//! the database sequentially.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let queue = LogWriteQueue::spawn(db.clone());
//! queue.write(job_id, &log_text).await;
//! ```
//!
//! # Stream-ready design
//!
//! The queue accepts any number of writes per job.  Future streaming log
//! support (runner sends lines during execution) can call `write()` for each
//! chunk without worrying about concurrent-write contention.
